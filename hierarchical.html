    <p>Hierarchical Database Model, as the name suggests, is a database model in which the data is arranged in a hierarchical tree edifice. As it is arranged based on the hierarchy, every record of data tree should have at least one parent, except for the child records in the last level, and each parent should have one or more child records. The Data can be accessed by following through the classified structure, always initiated from the Root or the first parent. Hence this model is named as Hierarchical Database Model</p>
