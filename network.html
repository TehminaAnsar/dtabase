    <h1>Network Model</h1>
    <p>The network model was created to represent complex data relationships more effectively than the hierarchical model, to improve database performance, and to impose a database standard.

In the network model, the user perceives the network database as a collection of records in 1:M relationships. However, unlike the hierarchical model, the network model allows a record to have more than one parent.

While the network database model is generally not used today, the definitions of standard database concepts that emerged with the network model are still used by modern data models.
